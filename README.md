# gestures.conf
This is my gestures.conf config file for the pantheon desktop using the libinput-gestures library.
3 fingers swipe to the left, tiles the window to the left, and to the right tiles it to the right. 3 fingers swipe up shows the windows overview and same with the 3 fingers swipe down. 4 fingers swipe up maximizes the window, 4 fingers swipe down un-maximizes the window. 4 fingers swipe left brings the second desktop, 4 fingers swip to the left goes back to the previous desktop.
This is not set in stone and you can make the gestures the way you want them. This is just how I like my trackpad to function like. I have done all of this with a combination of the libinput-gestures library https://github.com/bulletmark/libinput-gestures (read the installation instructions for your distro because you are going to need two more packages to install, wmctrl and xdotool), gestures app https://github.com/cunidev/gestures . If you can't get the gestures app for some reason, then just copy this .conf file and paste it into your ~/.config directory and it should work.
